# Governance

## Project Roles
- **Maintainers**: steward releases and roadmap; merge PRs after review.
- **Contributors**: propose changes via PRs; follow contribution guidelines.
- **Reviewers**: domain or stats reviewers who validate assumptions and methods.

## Decision-Making
- Decisions follow a **lazy consensus** model. If consensus is unclear, maintainers call a vote.
- Changes to **APIs**, **privacy defaults**, or **statistical methods** require 2 maintainer approvals.

## Releases
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Release notes must summarize: features, breaking changes, security/privacy updates, and reproducibility impacts.

## Code Ownership
- CODEOWNERS (optional) may designate reviewers for sensitive areas (stats, privacy, APIs).

## Conflicts of Interest
- Disclose relevant affiliations in PR descriptions when proposing method changes.
